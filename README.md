Natural-Language-Processing-Columbia-University
===============================================

This repo contains a record of the assignments for the Natural Language Processing course taught by Michael Collins. I 
followed the course online on coursera.org and the assignments are a collaboration between myself and Fraser Campbell 
(https://github.com/fraser-campbell). This is our attempt at the solutions to the problems and have not been verified through 
the coursera assessment as we completed the course after the deadline.
